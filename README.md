## üèó **Welcome to your new SDK!** üèó

It has been generated successfully based on your OpenAPI spec. However, it is not yet ready for production use. Here are some next steps:
- [ ] üõ† Make your SDK feel handcrafted by [customizing it](https://www.speakeasyapi.dev/docs/customize-sdks)
- [ ] ‚ôªÔ∏è Refine your SDK quickly by iterating locally with the [Speakeasy CLI](https://github.com/speakeasy-api/speakeasy)
- [ ] üéÅ Publish your SDK to package managers by [configuring automatic publishing](https://www.speakeasyapi.dev/docs/productionize-sdks/publish-sdks)
- [ ] ‚ú® When ready to productionize, delete this section from the README
<!-- Start SDK Installation -->
# SDK Installation

## NPM

```bash
npm add https://github.com/speakeasy-sdks/Plunk-sample-sdk
```

## Yarn

```bash
yarn add https://github.com/speakeasy-sdks/Plunk-sample-sdk
```
<!-- End SDK Installation -->

## SDK Example Usage
<!-- Start SDK Example Usage -->


```typescript
import { PetStoreAPI } from "Pet-Store-API";

(async () => {
    const sdk = new PetStoreAPI();

    const res = await sdk.petStoreAPI.deletePetsId({
        id: 623531,
    });

    if (res.statusCode == 200) {
        // handle response
    }
})();

```

# Available Resources and Operations

## [PetStoreAPI SDK](docs/sdks/petstoreapi/README.md)

* [deletePetsId](docs/sdks/petstoreapi/README.md#deletepetsid) - Delete a pet by ID
* [getPets](docs/sdks/petstoreapi/README.md#getpets) - List all pets
* [getPetsId](docs/sdks/petstoreapi/README.md#getpetsid) - Get a pet by ID
* [postPets](docs/sdks/petstoreapi/README.md#postpets) - Add a new pet
* [putPetsId](docs/sdks/petstoreapi/README.md#putpetsid) - Update a pet by ID
<!-- End SDK Available Operations -->

<!-- Start Dev Containers -->



<!-- End Dev Containers -->

<!-- Start Error Handling -->
# Error Handling

Handling errors in your SDK should largely match your expectations.  All operations return a response object or throw an error.  If Error objects are specified in your OpenAPI Spec, the SDK will throw the appropriate Error type.


<!-- End Error Handling -->

<!-- Start Custom HTTP Client -->
# Custom HTTP Client

The Typescript SDK makes API calls using the (axios)[https://axios-http.com/docs/intro] HTTP library.  In order to provide a convenient way to configure timeouts, cookies, proxies, custom headers, and other low-level configuration, you can initialize the SDK client with a custom `AxiosInstance` object.


For example, you could specify a header for every request that your sdk makes as follows:

```typescript
from Pet-Store-API import PetStoreAPI;
import axios;

const httpClient = axios.create({
    headers: {'x-custom-header': 'someValue'}
})


const sdk = new PetStoreAPI({defaultClient: httpClient});
```


<!-- End Custom HTTP Client -->

<!-- Placeholder for Future Speakeasy SDK Sections -->

# Development

## Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

## Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release!
